JRE Vs JDK

Java Runtime Environment - To run Java Apps
Java Development Kit  -  Provides Tool required to create Java App
  


To run java from command line:

Copy this C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14\bin

To set up the path:

Go to Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced System Settings > Click on Environment Variable > Click New for System Variables > Give name and path (C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14\bin).




To check Java installed or not for Windows:

java -version in command line




IDE - Integrated Development Environment

We will be using Intellij IDE by Jet Brains ( Intellij supports Java SE and Android)



Public - This particular class accessible anywhere
Static - we can call this method directly without creating object
Void   - return type
Main   - Name of the class

//Three ways to Comment the code:
1) Line Comment using //
2) Block Comment using /*...*/
3) Javadoc Comment using /**...*/

Variable is a storage location used to store any set of data.
Variables can be of different types:

Primitive data types are those which are built in the language and there are 4 in Java
1) Integer
2) Floating Point
3) Character
4) Boolean


Integer is divided into 4 sections:

   Type   Size   Min. Value   Max. Value       format

1) Byte   8  bits   -128 	128               0
2) short  16 bits   -32768	32767		  0
3) int	  32 bits   -214783648	214783647	  0
4) long   64 bits				  0L	


Floating Point

float    32 bit  0.0f
double   64 bit	 0.0 or 0.0d

boolean pass = true;
boolean pass = false;




Arithmetic Operators


1) Basic Operators like + - / * %
2) Prefix and Postfix operators like ++ --
3) Compound assignment operators like += -+ /= *= %=


string + string = string
string + number = string
number + string = string
number + number = number



Smallervalue%Largervalue then the Modulus is Smallervalue

Prefix applies operation before returning value,
Postfix applies operation after returning value,


Prefix is increment by 1
Postfix is decrement by 1




Compound assignment operators

It is a combination of operation and assignment
Applies result of right side to left side and store that result in variable
on left side
 

Type conversion


There are two types of type conversions:

1) Implicit
2) Explicit


Relational Operators:

>,>=,==,<,<=,!=



Conditional Assignment:

It is kind of single line if else condition
if something happens we do this n if that doesnt happen we do that.

Example:

result = some condition. If condition is true then true part of the code executes else false part
of the code executes

result = 10 > 5  ?   10-1:10+1


Conditions:

If Else statement:

if (condition) 

 true-statement;

else 

false-statement;




If Else If Statement:

if (condition)

statement;

elseif (condition)

statement;

else (condition)

statement;



Nested If Condition:

if (test1>test2)
            if (test2>test3)
                System.out.println("test1 is greater. " + "value of test1 is " +test1);

            else

                System.out.println("test2 is greater. " + "value of test2 is " +test2);

else
    System.out.println("test3 is greater. " + "value of test3 is " +test3);







Local Variables: Accesible only in the local scope

Global Variables: Accessible globally.

Example of Local and Global Variables:


        int test1 = 20;
        int test2 = 25;
        int test3 = 35;
        String text2 = "I am outside the block";

        if (test1 < test2) {
            String text1 = "I am inside the block";
            System.out.println("test1 is smaller");
            System.out.println("text1>>> " + text1);

        } else {
            System.out.println("test2 is smaller");
        }

        //System.out.println("text1>>> " + text1);
        System.out.println("text2>>>> " + text2);





Logical Operators:

And         &                 
OR          |   
XOR         ^
Negation    !   

Example:

        int a = 20, b = 10, c = 5;

        if (a>b & b>c)
            System.out.println("a is greatest");


Conditional Logical Operators:

Conditional And   &&

Conditional Or    ||

&& - Only execute right-side if left side is true
|| - Only execute right-side if left side is false


Example:

you are admin && you have access = Allow if both true
you are admin || you have access = Allow if anyone true




Switch Case:


switch (condition) {
case out1:
execute
case out2:
execute
default:
execute
}




Looping:

1) While Loop
2) Do While Loop
3) For Loop





While Loop:

Repeatedly execute the statement as long as the condition is true.
Condition check at the loop start
Statement may never execute

   int a = 10;


        while (a>=1){
            System.out.println("Value of a = "+a);
            a--;

        }

Do While Loop:

Repeatedly execute the statement as long as the condition is true.
Condition check at the end
statement always executes atlease once



        int a = 10;

do{


    System.out.println("Value of a = "+a);
    a--;

}
        while (a>=1);





For Loop:


Repeatedly execute the statement as long as the condition is true.
Condition check at the loop start
Provide simplified notation for loop control value


        System.out.println("The output is ");


                for (int a = 10; a >=1 ; a--)
        {
            System.out.println(a);
        }




Array:

It is a collection of hetrogenous data types
Provide an ordered collection of elements.
Each element accessed via an index
index range from 0 to number of elements - 1
Number of elements can be found via array length

        float[] mymarks = new float[3];
        mymarks[0] = 10.0f;
        mymarks[1] = 20.0f;
mymarks[2] = 30.0f;

float sum = 0.0f;


        for ( int i=0; i < mymarks.length;i++)

            sum = sum + mymarks[i];
        System.out.println(sum);



For Each:

     int [] marks = {10,20,30,40};
        int total = 0;

        for (int initVal: marks) {

            total = total + initVal;
        }
        System.out.println(total);
